### Introduction to Functional Approximation Methods in Reinforcement Learning

This project implements various examples found in [R. Sutton and A. Barto's “Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction”](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf).

State aggregation via tile coding + SARSA and Q-learning implementations are included.
